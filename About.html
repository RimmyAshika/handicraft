                        of India’s artisans with the world. We hope to be able to raise the dignity
                        of the Indian artisan in our own way and kindle an interest and support for
                        an unsurpassed legacy of craft that spans millennia and spreads across the length
                        and breadth of the land. It is our effort to curate an undeniably unique selection of
                        traditional art and craft translated into a range of beautiful, contemporary products.

                            boundaries of India. The world of its craftspeople, with their hand made goods
                             and textiles, spans millennia and spreads across the length and breadth of the land.

                <p class="craft-dec">Helping Craft remain a sustainable, viable 
                    livelihood alternative for craftspeople and their next generations 
                    is a tremendous challenge facing the sector across the country.
                     A large variety of beautiful, rural craft does not make it to the
                      popular markets and stores, remaining limited to local town centric 
                      sales and periodic exhibitions in larger cities. A vast number of artisans
                       are still struggling with livelihoods. Perhaps the most important
                        objective we hope to achieve for these artisans, is in terms of being
                         able to reach new markets and create new age, contemporary products 
                         setting into motion a cycle of repeat orders and purchase. This in turn
                          would help in making craft a lucrative work option for the younger
                           generations of these artist villages.
